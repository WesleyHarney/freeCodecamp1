		<h3>Musical History</h3>
		<p>
			Nina Simone (/ˈniːnə sɪˈmoʊn/; born Eunice Kathleen Waymon;
			February 21, 1933 – April 21, 2003) was an American singer,
			songwriter, pianist, arranger, and activist in the Civil Rights Movement.
			 Simone employed a broad range of musical styles including
			 classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop.
			<br>
			<br>
			To make a living, Eunice Waymon changed her name to "Nina Simone".
			The change related to her need to disguise herself from family members,
			having chosen to play "the devil's music" or "cocktail piano" at a
			nightclub in Atlantic City. She was told in the nightclub that she would
			have to sing to her own accompaniment,
			and this effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist.

		<h3>Activism</h3>

		<p>
By the mid-1960s, Simone became known as the voice of the Civil Rights Movement.
 She wrote "Mississippi Goddam" in response to the 1963 assassination of
 Medgar Evers and the Birmingham church bombing that killed four young
 African-American girls.
<br>
 She also penned "Four Women," chronicling the complex
 histories of a quartet of African-American female figures, and
 <br>
 "Young, Gifted and Black," borrowing the title of a play by Hansberry,
 which became a popular anthem.
<br>
 After the assassination of
 Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, Simone's bassist Greg Taylor penned
 "Why (The King of Love Is Dead)," which was performed by the singer and her
 band at the Westbury Music Festival.

		<h3>Later Life</h3>

		<p>
			In 1999, Simone performed at the Guinness Blues Festival in
			Dublin, Ireland. She was joined on stage by her daughter Lisa Simone Kelly
			 for a few songs. Lisa, from Simone's second marriage to manager
			  Andrew Stroud, followed in her mother's footsteps. Among an array of
				performance accomplishments, she has appeared on Broadway in Aida, using
				 the stage name "Simone."
<br>
<br>
In her final years, reports indicated that Nina Simone was battling
breast cancer. She died at the age of 70 on April 21, 2003, at her
home in Carry-le-Rouet, France.
<br>
<br>
While she may be gone, Simone left a lasting impression on the world of
music, art and activism. She sang to share her truth, and her work still
resonates with great emotion and power. Simone has inspired an array of
performers, including Aretha Franklin, Laura Nyro, Joni Mitchell,
Lauryn Hill and Meshell Ndegeocello. Her deep, distinctive voice
continues to be a popular choice for television and film soundtracks.
